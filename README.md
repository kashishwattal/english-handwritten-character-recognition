## english-handwritten-character-recognition
The project focuses on recognition of isolated offline handwritten uppercase English alphabets. It was completed in 2018.

It uses HOG feature extraction to extract features from images and uses a simple Machine Learning model, k Nearest Neighbours to predict the classes of the characters.

For the char74k dataset which had 1430 images, the method achieves an accuracy of 94% for 286 images.

For the NIST 2016 character recognition dataset, 104000 images were extracted into classes. The method achieves an accuracy of 87% for 20800 images.
